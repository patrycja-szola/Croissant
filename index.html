    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape,
      the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance,
      and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche
      dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries
      and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
      century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with
      a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
      notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
      American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in
      French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough. Croissants
      are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
